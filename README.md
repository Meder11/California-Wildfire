ðŸš€ California Wildfire Analysis: SQL, Python & Power BI ðŸ”¥

I recently worked on a data-driven project analyzing wildfires in California, leveraging SQL, Python, and Power BI to uncover key insights.

ðŸ”¹ SQL â€“ Queried and cleaned wildfire incident data
ðŸ”¹ Python â€“ Processed, transformed, and prepared data for visualization
ðŸ”¹ Power BI â€“ Built interactive dashboards to analyze wildfire causes, damages, and financial impact

Key Insights:
âœ… Human activity & lightning are major wildfire causes
âœ… Sonoma County faces the highest fire risk
âœ… Financial losses exceed millions, emphasizing the need for better mitigation strategies

This project strengthened my data wrangling, visualization, and analytical skills, and Iâ€™m excited to apply these insights to real-world problem-solving! ðŸš€
